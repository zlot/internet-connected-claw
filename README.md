#The Claw

An internet-connected robotic claw, strapped together using rubber bands and tape, controllable via the web, and built in a day. Partner up with others to try and simultaneously control its grip!

Created in a day, displayed at General Assembly Sydney's Hour of Code event,
2 December 2016, as part of (Sydney Interactive Arts Meetup)[http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Interactive-Arts-Meetup/].
